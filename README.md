# Astronomy photo camera android app
### Created as a summer hobby project, it features:
* Variable exposure and ISO settings
* Long exposure stacking to create star trails
* Automatic satelite/meteor removal, which is done through stacking consecutive photos

### Since it uses specific manual settings, it utilises the Camera2 API
